SATANOS USER GUIDE: READ THE LEGAL THING FIRST!! : im not responsible for any suicide or self-harm this OS caused. Its not for harming anyone. I just poured my all hate towards humanity people and life into a operating system. Yeah thats a open source operating system you can use the code of it for developing it or customising it BUT DO NOT CLAIM YOU CREATED THE SATANOS. IF YOU DO IT, THEN FUCK YOU. Now lets go to the part 2, running it on a VM. Firstly its not working on Virtualbox or VMware. Only on Qemu. If you wanna install Qemu on your device, follow these insturactions: On debian/ubuntu: open terminal and write sudo apt install qemu-system-x86.  On arch based: instead of staring at the neofetch for hours, type : sudo pacman -S qemu.  On fedora based: sudo dnf install qemu.  On windows (do people still use it?) : open firefox and copypaste that link: https://qemu.weilnetz.de/ then install the qemu.  On macOS: brew install qemu  On reactOS: https://qemu.weilnetz.de/  Now you installed QEMU. Lets run satanOS on QEMU. First, open terminal and write: cd (path of the satanos folder) for example: cd /home/user/Desktop/greatimage (greatimage folder is the folder where you should keep the satanos.img file) and then copypaste that command: 'qemu-system-i386 -fda satanos.img -m 16M -vga std -no-reboot'  then, it should be launched on qemu. Good luck using my OS. If you have any problems with the OS, you can reach to my socials for support: Reddit: u/shametolive   Discord: @qwd32  Email: razerthelockerLOL@proton.me  Have a good day programmer!
